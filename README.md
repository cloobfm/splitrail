# Splitrail

Splitrail is a **fast, cross-platform, real-time Claude Code / Codex / Kilo Code / Cline / Roo Code / Qwen Code token usage tracker and cost monitor.**  Run one command to instantly review all of your CLI coding agent usage.  Upload your usage data to your private account on the [Splitrail Cloud](https://splitrail.dev) for safe-keeping and cross-machine usage aggregation.

**Download the binary for your platform on the [Releases](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/splitrail/releases) page.**

## Development

### Windows

On Windows, we use `lld-link.exe` from LLVM to significantly speed up compilation, so you'll need to install it to compile Splitrail.  Example for `winget`:

```shell
winget install --id LLVM.LLVM
```

Then add it to your system PATH:
```cmd
:: Command prompt
setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\"
set "PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"
```
or
```pwsh
# PowerShell
setx /M PATH "$env:PATH;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\"
$env:PATH = "$env:PATH;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\"
```

Then use standard Cargo commands to build and run:

```shell
cargo run
```

### macOS/Linux

Build as normal:
```
cargo run
```
